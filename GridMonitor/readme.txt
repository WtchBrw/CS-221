OVERVIEW:



 - INCLUDED FILES:

 * GridMonitor.java - source file
 * GridMonitorInterface.java - source file
 * GridMonitorTest.java - source file
 * readme.txt - this file
 
 - COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 $ javac GridMonitor.java

 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java GridMonitor

 Console output will give the results of all tests after the program
 finishes executing.
 
 - PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 The GridMonitor.java file contains all the tests that can be run on the grid files
 being used. The test files are to be supplied by the user.
 
 The GridMonitorInterface.java file contains all the methods that needed to be defined
 within GridMonitor. However, the implementation of the class could
 easily be removed after the methods are all defined in order to cut down on the
 program size and number of dependencies. The test files were removed from this
 package for that reason.
 
 - TESTING:
 Getting the program to work was tricky at first because it has been a long time
 since I last used Java to program. However after attending a few lectures surrounding the
 concepts used in this program, the process of developing it became exponentially easier.
